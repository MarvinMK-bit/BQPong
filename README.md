Bitcoin Quantum Pong - Text version

The game is set in an apocalyptic dystopia. The internet has been destroyed by WW3, but Bitcoin is still a valuable digital currency that can be transmitted around the world.

The game has two players, Player 1 and Player 2. They are recruits in a guessing-pong game.
On Player 1's turn, the game generates a Bitcoin key and sends Player 1 and 2 a random key that it shall use to encode that Bitcoin key. Either of the two players must correctly guess the random key, and then use it to communicate the secret message to its true recipient. 

The random key has 8 bit elements and the two players, Player 1 and Player 2, take turns to guess these elements in their order from 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Player 1 is confined to classical guesswork, while Player 2 is allowed to use a quantum computer on the key received.

The winner gets a job with the MENTATS corporation.
